Engineered a deep learning model using Keras on the Lending Club dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of 90% for loan defaults, which aids financial institutions in risk assessment.

- Performed EDA,preprocessing,feature engineering on Kaggle Lending Club dataset with 490k+ records using Python libraries like Pandas,Seaborn etc.
- Used Keras to build a neural network with 90% accuracy which could be used by financial institutions to assess the risk of borrowers failing to repay their loans.
